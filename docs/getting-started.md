# Getting Started

Welcome to QuantTradeAI! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## ðŸš€ Quick Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (recommended) or pip

### Install with Poetry (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AKKI0511/QuantTradeAI.git
cd QuantTradeAI

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

### Install with pip
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AKKI0511/QuantTradeAI.git
cd QuantTradeAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸŽ¯ First Steps

### 1. Fetch Data
```bash
# Fetch data for all configured symbols
poetry run quanttradeai fetch-data
```

This will download OHLCV data for AAPL, META, TSLA, JPM, and AMZN and cache it locally.

### 2. Run Training Pipeline
```bash
# Run the complete training pipeline
poetry run quanttradeai train
```

This will:
- Process the data and generate features
- Train ensemble models for each symbol
- Optimize hyperparameters automatically
- Save trained models

### 3. Evaluate Results
```bash
# Evaluate a trained model
poetry run quanttradeai evaluate -m models/trained/AAPL
```

## ðŸ“Š Understanding the Output

After running the training pipeline, you'll find:

- **Trained Models**: `models/trained/` - Saved models for each symbol
- **Experiment Results**: `models/experiments/` - Training logs and metrics
- **Cached Data**: `data/raw/` - Downloaded OHLCV data
- **Processed Data**: `data/processed/` - Feature-engineered data

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The framework uses two main configuration files:

- **`config/model_config.yaml`** - Model parameters and data settings
- **`config/features_config.yaml`** - Feature engineering settings

See the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for detailed settings.

- **[API Reference](api/)** - Detailed API documentation

- **[Configuration](configuration.md)** - Configuration options

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Data fetching fails:**
```bash
# Force refresh data
poetry run quanttradeai fetch-data --refresh
```

**Training takes too long:**
- Reduce `n_trials` in hyperparameter optimization
- Use fewer symbols in configuration

**Memory issues:**
- Reduce the date range in configuration
- Process symbols one at a time

### Getting Help

- Check the [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) for common patterns
- Review the [API Reference](api/) for detailed function documentation
- See the [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) for complete workflow examples
- Open an [issue](https://github.com/AKKI0511/QuantTradeAI/issues) for bugs
