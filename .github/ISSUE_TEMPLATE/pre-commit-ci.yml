        This task adds a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `pre-commit` on every pull request to ensure formatting, linting, and tests (as configured) pass before merge.

        1. Create `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml` with the following:
           ```yaml
           name: pre-commit
           on:
             pull_request:
             push:
               branches: [ main, master ]
           jobs:
             run:
               runs-on: ubuntu-latest
               steps:
                 - uses: actions/checkout@v4
                 - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
                   with:
                     python-version: '3.11'
                 - name: Install Poetry
                   run: |
                     pipx install poetry
                 - name: Install dependencies
                   run: |
                     poetry install --with dev
                 - name: Run pre-commit
                   run: |
                     poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
           ```
        2. Verify the workflow passes on an example PR.
        3. Optionally add a status badge to `README.md`.
